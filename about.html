            <p>
                I truly had one of the best experiences I have ever had in my life after doing Hot Yoga. It is hard to
                put in to words, but I felt mentally and physically "changed" after a one hour session. I will be back
                many, many times after just the one experience. I can't thank you guys enough. I really enjoyed the
                entire experience and have already recommended it to just about everyone I have spoken to. Thanks again!

            <p>I've heard about you guys from my girlfriend and sister-in-law. So I figured I would try it. It was my
                first yoga class and it was very enjoyable. I will definitely be back when I'm not at the firehouse. It
                was truly enjoyable. Thanks.

            <p>I just recently moved to the area and I found out about your space online. Checked out the rooftop event
                on Saturday and it was AWESOME!! I loved it!! And Ann was wonderful, great vibes. I'll definitely come
                back :)

                Life throws a lot at us, and finding “You Time” isn’t always easy. With about 70 classes a week, some as
                early as 6AM, and as late as 7PM, you should have no problem fitting a class in your busy schedule.</p>
