Navigation Bar

Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar as I had used and activated the flex to make my work a bit easier for me includes links to the Home page, About, Pricing and Sign Up/contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. It has a hover effect of changing colors and adding un underline as well as scaling up to add a modern effect to it.
This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

The landing page 

The landing page includes a photograph of a young lady doing a yoga pose with text overlay to allow the user to see exactly what and for whom this site is directed towards. It also includes a link to a winter offer so the potential users can sign up quicker.

Main section on home page includes the name of the business and a link that takes you to a contact page and it is for a promotion BYS is doing during the winter months.
Link has a hover effect of changing the color of the text and scaling up for a modern effect.

The Footer

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites and an direct email for Best Yoga Studio. The footer is identical on all four different pages of BYS site. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.

About

The about page provides visitors with information about hours of operation and a informative video about BYS as well as testimonials which is a big part of most of the similar web sites.

Pricing

Pricing page provides users with two different pricing options subject to change in the future as one of the options is a promo that the studio is doing to attract new clients during winter months. Clicking on the Sign up here takes the user to the sign up page.

Sign up page

This page will allow the user to get signed up. The user will be able specify if they would like to sign up normal pricing or winter months promo. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address. I have decides against using the labels because I think it looks cleaner without it. In place of labels I have used placeholders.
