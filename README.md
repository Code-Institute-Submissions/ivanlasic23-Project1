### Navigation Bar

Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar as I had used and activated the flex to make my work a bit easier for me includes links to the Home page, Abour, Pricing and Sign Up/contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. It has a hover effect of changing colors and adding un underline as well as scaling up to add a modern effect to it.
This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

The about page provides visitors with information about hours of operation and a informative video about BYS as well as the testimonials.

Pricing page provides users with two different pricing options subject to change in the future as one of the options is a promo that the studio is doing to attract new clients during winter months. Clicking on the Sign up here takes the user to the contact page.

Contact page

This page will allow the user to get signed up. The user will be able specify if they would like to take part normal pricing or winter months promo. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address. I have decides against using the labels because I think it looks cleaner without it.
