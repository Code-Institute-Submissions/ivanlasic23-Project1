## Unfixed Bugs

### Working with only HTML and CSS responsiveness is not perfect as it would require many media queries. I have only used three breakpoints

## The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
### In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
### From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch

### Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
