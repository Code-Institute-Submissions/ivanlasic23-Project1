<li>Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar as I had used and activated the flex to make my work a bit easier for me includes links to the Home page, Abour, Pricing and Sign Up/contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. It has a hover effect of changing colors and adding un underline as well as scaling up to add a modern effect to it.</li>

# Unfixed Bugs

### Working with only HTML and CSS responsiveness is not perfect as it would require many media queries. I have only used three breakpoints. 


# Deployment
## The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
### In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
### From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch

### Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
### There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
### The code can be run locally through clone or download.
### You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
### The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
### The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
### The live link can be found here - https://ivanlasic23.github.io/Project1/index.html
